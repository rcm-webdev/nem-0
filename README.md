Nem-0 is an AI-powered business advisor agent with long-term memory, built for small business owners who need a knowledgeable, always-available advisor at their side. Unlike typical AI chat tools, Nem-0 remembers everything; your business history, goals, challenges, and decisions are all stored and recalled automatically. No need to re-explain your situation every session. Nem-0 picks up right where you left off.

## How its made: 

Tech Stack: 
- Frontend: Vite + React + Tailwindcss
- Backend: FastAPI + Mem0
- Database: Supbase
- OpenAI API

## AI first development: 
- The goal was to create an AI agent with memory, building up from [Vega](https://github.com/rcm-webdev/vega-autonomous-ai-agent)
- Followed mem0 documentation and started collaborating with claude code to create a FastAPI
- Utilized [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) for rapid-prototyping the front-end layer with a Vite + React vs Next.js
